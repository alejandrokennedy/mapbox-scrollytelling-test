For one, sediment behind dams is itself often contaminated after years of collecting whatever went into the river upstream, whether runoff from farms or tailings from mines. Contamination could also come from more mundane sources in the floodplain, like wastewater treatment plants or the old paint cans rusting in people’s basements. <br><br> “The fish downstream don't care if contaminants came from your garage or Dow Chemical,” said Burton. <br><br> By building engineered structures or taking other resiliency measures, the most hazardous waste sites can be designed to withstand flooding, explained Carter, who recently published a report for the Union of Concerned Scientists on coastal flooding hazards to Superfund sites. <br><br> But in order to prepare for floods, Carter said, flooding hazards have to be recognized first, whether they come from rising seas, increasing storm surge, or aging dams.",

The report outlines how in addition to more extreme weather, factors like changes in land use, sediment buildup, and changing frequencies of wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles all can contribute to a higher probability of dam failure. <br><br> Several state dam safety programs contacted by Undark said they are planning for climate change-related impacts to dam infrastructure, though Colorado is the only state with dam safety rules which account for climate change, by requiring dam designs “to account for expected increases in temperature and associated increases in atmospheric moisture.” <br><br> “We were the first state to do to take that step, but I wouldn't be surprised if others, you know, follow that lead,” said McCormick, the Colorado dam safety chief.",
